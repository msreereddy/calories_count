Introduction
A calorie is a measure of energy expenditure and stored energy. The calories referred to in diet (calories eaten) and exercise (calories burned) are kilocalories (kcal). One kilocalorie is equal to the amount of heat that will raise the
temperature of one kilogram of water by one degree Celsius at sea level. One
kilocalorie is equal to 4186.8 joules and 1000 calories (small calories) as
referred to in science labs for heat energy. Food has always been essential in human life and attracted people’s attention
more than before. Each food items have each nutritious value which may be high
or low. Therefore, a food detection system is essential that can automatically
show their nutritious value of food items and calculate the calories based on the
amount of food that the user intakes by capturing the image of the food. Physical
activity burns calories beyond the basal metabolic rate. Your muscles use both
readily available and stored energy sources in your body. The exercise calories
burned during cardiovascular activities such as walking, running, swimming, and
cycling depend on the intensity of the exercise, your body weight, and the amount
of time you spend exercising. Moderate intensity exercises such as brisk walking
burn fewer calories per minute than more vigorous-intensity exercises such as
running. For example, you can use a walking calorie chart to find out how many calories
you can burn per mile based on your weight and speed. Walking burns
approximately 90 calories per mile for a 160-pound person. Depending on
the duration and intensity of exercise, your body burns available blood sugar, glycogen stored in the muscles and liver, fat and, if required, even begins to burn
muscle protein. Some people aim to exercise at 60 percent to 70 percent of their
maximum heart rate to burn body fat. In that fat-burning zone, 85 percent of the
calories you burn are from fat. However, you’ll burn more total calories
per minute if you exercise at a higher intensity. The” fat- burning” zone is more
tolerable for many people and might allow you to exercise for a longer period of
time. But if you work out for a shorter period of time, a higher intensity session
will help you to burn more calories. Fitness monitors and pedometers often estimate calories burned based on your
weight, number of steps taken, speed, pace, and intensity. It is generally more
accurate if the exercise intensity is measured by the heart rate during exercise. You may use hand grip pulse monitors on a treadmill or elliptical trainer for a
more accurate estimate.
